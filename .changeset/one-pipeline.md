One watch pipeline and one navigation. Every workspace now watches through the same pipeline as `webstir build`, so watch shows what a build produces (the app shell, partials and `<main>`'s attributes included), and a rebuild that fails a build check keeps serving the last valid page. With client-nav on, an edit to a page's code shows the page again from the new code, in place, keeping scroll and focus; CSS edits still swap in place. New `spa` and `full` apps start with client-nav on. The unused SPA router is gone: `webstir enable spa` now points to client-nav, new apps no longer get `router.ts`, `navigation.ts` or `router-types.ts`, and `webstir repair` lists them in older apps without deleting them. The unused `--hmr-verbose` flag is removed, and `enable.spa` is no longer read or reported by `inspect`.
