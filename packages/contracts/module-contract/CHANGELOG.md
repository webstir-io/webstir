# @webstir-io/module-contract

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 6e3ebf5: An app is what its files say it is: pages when it has `src/frontend/`, a server when it has `src/backend/index.ts`. `webstir.mode` is gone, and so is choosing a shape once at `init`.
  
  - **Build, watch, test, publish, inspect, doctor and repair** follow the app's files. A published deploy reads what `publish` wrote.
  - **Apps without a server** (what `spa` and `ssg` were) publish as static sites for any static host. Their pages render at publish (a view) or in the browser (a `data.ts`).
  - **Page routes on static hosts:** a view that routes an address pattern to a page (`/items/:id`) works on a static host. Publish writes the page at fixed addresses, a `_redirects` rewrite for Netlify and Cloudflare Pages, and a `404.html` that loads the routed page for GitHub Pages, S3 and the rest.
  - **One bindings check for every app:** a page with bindings needs something to render it. In watch, a rejected edit keeps the last valid page.
  - **Growing an app:** `webstir enable backend` adds a server to any app, and the new `webstir enable frontend` adds pages to a server-only app.
  - **`init` and `refresh` take a starter** (`full`, `spa`, `ssg`, `api`), which only picks the starting template.
  - **`repair`** removes `webstir.mode` and `webstir.enable.backend` from existing apps.
  - **Removed:**
    - `publish --frontend-mode`
    - the frontend package's `checkSpaTemplates` and `assertNoSpaBindings`
    - `publishMode`
  
    The frontend package CLI still accepts, and ignores, `publish -m`, so deploy scripts written by earlier versions keep working.
  - **`add-page`** makes a page with a script in every app; `--no-script` makes one without.
  - **Output and JSON** report `layers: { pages, server }` instead of `mode`.
  - **Fixed:** a dependency install that runs quietly (as `webstir agent` runs it) no longer stalls when the install prints more than a pipe holds.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- ff5d7f4: Pages can render in the browser from the same template a server renders: add a `data.ts` beside a page (its data schema and first-load `initial` data), export `load` from the page script, and Webstir checks the bindings at build time, ships the page rendered with `initial`, renders the loaded data in the browser (before the swap with client-nav), and gives `setup` a `render(data)` to update it. SPA workspaces can now use bindings on such pages. `@webstir-io/module-contract/render` exposes the dependency-free executor for the browser.
